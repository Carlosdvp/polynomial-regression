## Dep Learning for Coders using TensorflowJS

- Beforewe get to the "Recognizing Cats and Dofs" exercise used in the Lesson, I'll do a simpler version taken from the Tensorflow Site > Imae classification using the MNIST handwriting dataset.
- It might be a simpler approach but still within the Image Classification arena.

### Goals:

1. Use the Juyter Notebooks with the NodeJS kernel to work through the TensorflowJS exercises; and eventually to be able to use the tool with ease for ML, AI and data manipulation with JS.

Goals for the current exrcise:

- Import the TensorFlow lib into the Notebooks
	- visualize the linear regression exercise
- access the data and pull it into the notebook
- Build the model
- Import the TensorFlow lib into the Notebooks




### Update:

Something broke with the Node kernel (iJavascript) in the Jupyter Notebooks; the kernel won't start properly; and trying to re-install it crahses with a strange error. Updating Anaconda and the Notebooks seemed to do the trick but on the backend the problem persists.

So I will move away from it for now, and use tensorflowJS along with D3JS for the visualizing.
